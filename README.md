# Haste
- Ideally, the ultimate Nmap script for CTF endeavours. Not quite yet there but someday.
- I need to work on the scripts feature to make ir more smooth.
> [!CAUTION]
> Very vey noisy, that's why is fast... pls don't use it outside of CTF environments, it will disrupt any network and will get you ban or arrested.
# Usage
- Example:
```sh
haste <IP> <host.htb> -full 
```
- `HOSTNAME`: This is an optional hostname to be added to the `/etc/hosts` file.
- `-udp`: Performs a `UDP` only scan.
- `-full`: Performs both `TCP` and `UDP` scans.
>[!NOTE]
>`<DIRECTORY_NAME>`: This feature is mainly designed to be used on HackTheBox; where domains normally are `box.htb`
